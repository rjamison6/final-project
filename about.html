	<h1>About me</h1>
	<article class="right"><img src="images/vedder fairing.jpg" alt="My first airhead"></article>
  <article class="left1"><p1>I have wanted an old BMW® boxer since 2010. In 2017, I almost bought an R100/7, but I got a R1200GS instead. I never lost interest in those old bikes, and in 2018, I bought my first old airhead. I now have three airheads from different eras. To me, the appeal of these bikes is simple: they are well built, good looking and desirable in today's competitive market. They never go out of style. Proof of this is in the market for Triumph and other motorcycle makers that keep putting out that retro cool style. These bikes look as good today as they did the day they were first made. I am passionate about these bikes, and I want to share that passion with you.</p1>
